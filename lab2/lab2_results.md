1. Using zero-shot would be a good idea when you want the results to be direct and accurate, and you want them to be the same every time. You would use it when you believe it will answer correctly with the best choice.
2. Few-shot prompting would be a good idea when you are trying to give it tasks it may not already have, and you need to provide it with more information (examples) to help it with that. 
3. In 3.11 it correctly classified each of the emails. They were labeled correctly. In 3.12, some of the emails were classified and labeled incorrectly. It classified them based on the labels, so with incorrect example labels it provided incorrect email labeling.
4. The generated code changed quite a bit. Instead of just following the examples as templates for its answer, it created its answers itself. This actually led to it providing more information and examples in each of its answers.
