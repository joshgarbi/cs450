Questions to answer: For each of these stages would you pick either: a) creative LLM parameter settings or b) consistent parameter settings and why?

    Requirements and Ideation
        Define creative parameters as you want as many ideas as possible and this is the more brainstorming stages
    Design and Architecture
        Still more creative parameters but I would say less than the previous sage as you should have more of idea of what you want just not how.
    Implementation
        Leaning more on the consistent side as you know both what you want and a general way to get there it just needs to be done.
    Testing & QA
        consistent parameters are ideal for testing because verifying behavior requiors consistant input, creative parameters can also be used here to create unexpected parameters and test weird behavior in the system.
    Deployment & Maintenance
        Deployment has to follow the same steps for every change and in order to maintain the project the model needs a consistant understanding of its functions.
